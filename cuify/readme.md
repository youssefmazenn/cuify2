# CUIfy the XR: An Open-Source Package to Embed LLM-powered Conversational Agents in XR

This project consists of a Python server and a Unity client that work together to provide advanced speech and language processing capabilities, including speech-to-text (STT), text-to-speech (TTS), and large language model (LLM) interactions.

## Overview

- **Python Server**: Handles the core processing, including speech recognition, text synthesis, and natural language processing via APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Amazon).
- **Unity Client**: A user interface in Unity that communicates with the server for interactive speech and language tasks.

## Setup

For details on installation, configuration, and usage, please refer to the respective README files in each component's directory:

- [Server](Server/readme.md)
- [Client](Unity/readme.md)
